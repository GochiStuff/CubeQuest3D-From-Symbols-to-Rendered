# Rotating 3D Cube Console Animation

A C++ program that generates a rotating 3D cube animation in the console. This simple graphics project demonstrates basic 3D rendering and projection techniques, using ASCII characters to represent the cube in 2D on the terminal.

## Features
- Renders a 3D cube using ASCII characters.
- Rotates the cube around two axes (`A` and `B`) to create a dynamic 3D effect.
- Utilizes basic depth buffering to handle occlusion, displaying only the front-facing surfaces.
- Lightweight and cross-platform, designed to work in most terminal environments.

## Preview
The program displays a continuously rotating ASCII cube in the console. Each frame is rendered in place, so it gives the appearance of real-time rotation.
